# Shared File Protocol

Agents communicate via files in `.multi-agent/<feature-name>/`. Files are grouped by phase subdirectories and created on-demand as needed, while a small set of root runtime artifacts is maintained directly by the orchestrator.

## Root files

- `state.json` — current workflow phase; orchestrator drives transitions
- `requirements.md` — initial request passed to architect
- `context.md` — auto-generated rules/session info injected into prompts
- `runtime_state.json` / `orchestrator.log` — runtime tracking and orchestrator logs
- `created_files.log` — append-only created-file history written by the orchestrator as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  relative/path`; records files only (not directories), deduplicated by relative path, and seeded once at startup to include pre-existing session files

## Product Management (`01_product_management/`)

- `product_manager_prompt.md` — prompt for PM analysis phase
- `analysis.md` — PM write-up (business case, integration assessment, alternatives)
- `done` — completion marker for PM handoff to planning

## Planning (`02_planning/`)

- `architect_prompt.md` / `changes_prompt.txt` — architect prompts
- `plan.md` / `tasks.md` / `plan_meta.json` — architect planning artifacts
- `plan_*.md` — subplan files for parallel coder runs

## Research (`03_research/`)

- `code-<topic>/request.md` / `summary.md` / `detail.md` / `done` / `prompt.md`
- `web-<topic>/request.md` / `summary.md` / `detail.md` / `done` / `prompt.md`

## Design (`04_design/`)

- `designer_prompt.md` / `design.md`

## Implementation (`05_implementation/`)

- `coder_prompt.md` / `coder_prompt_*.txt`
- `done_*` — coder completion markers for single or parallel implementation/fixing runs

## Review (`06_review/`)

- `review_prompt.md` / `review.md`
- `fix_prompt.txt` / `fix_request.md`

## Docs (`07_docs/`)

- `docs_prompt.txt` / `docs_done`

## Completion (`08_completion/`)

- `confirmation_prompt.md` / `approval.json`
- `changes.md`

## Key functions

- `orchestrate()` in `agentmux/pipeline.py` — main file-watch loop; starts/stops the session file monitor and drives phase-cycle transitions
- `start_session_file_monitor()` in `agentmux/session_events.py` — wires wake + created-file listeners, seeds pre-existing files, and starts the recursive watchdog observer
- `FeatureEventHandler` / `SessionFileEventDispatcher` in `agentmux/session_events.py` — normalize watchdog events under the feature directory and fan them out to listeners
- `CreatedFilesLogListener` / `seed_existing_files()` in `agentmux/session_events.py` — enforce created-file logging semantics (`created_files.log`, first-seen only, bootstrap coverage)
- `build_initial_prompts()` in `agentmux/prompts.py` — builds only the architect prompt at startup
- `build_*_prompt()` in `agentmux/prompts.py` — loads and renders the markdown template for each phase; called lazily by handlers
- Handler functions in `agentmux/handlers.py` — each builds and writes its prompt file just before sending to agent
